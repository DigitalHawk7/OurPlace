      <h2>A Little About Us</h2>
        <p>Being a family owned company you would think it would be hard to maintain
          a professional appearance and approach to the way Our Place is run. In all reality
          it makes it easier because we can always be honest with each other and
          we know all of our knicks and knacks of each other. We have always wanted to
          own our own restaurant and when we saw the opportunity in small town Stanhope,
          Iowa we jumped at the chance to show our strengths and what we can do to help the town.</p>
        <p>As advocates of small town businesses, because we are a small town business ourselves,
          we have taken it upon ourselves to help promote the amazing meat locker right next door.
          All our red meats come from the local Stanhope Meat Locker and are always fresh. We pride
          ourselves in customer statisfaction from drinks and food served to conversations with
          our staff if an ear is needed.</p>
        <p>A little about the structure: All the wood that you see when entering Our Place is handmade
          by someone in our family from real cedar.</p>
